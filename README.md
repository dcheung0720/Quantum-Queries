# Chicago Crime Analysis
<body>
    <h2>Goal: To see whether Chicago is becoming more Violent from 2017 - 2023</h2>
    <h6>The visualizations can be seen in the following website: https://chicagocrimeanalysis-a24e2.web.app/</h6>
    <h6>The data source for our data was retrieved from: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2</h6>
    <p>Ethical Consideration: our data visualizations show that certain areas have a higher crime rates than other area but the difference cannot be explained by our graphs. This is because there are other factors that we haven't considered, such as race, age, police activity, or the lingering effects of Redlining. As a result, our visualizations do not call for any immediate actions to "fix" the increasing violent crime rates as we do not have a full picture of the social and economic problems that are associated with each crime.</p>
    <p>The website was built using ReactJS which was styled using Material UI. The data are stored in Firebase's real time database and the visualizations were created using React d3, React Leaflet, matplotlib, and other Python Libraries.</p>
